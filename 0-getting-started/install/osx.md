# Using the installer #

__Prerequisites:__ We provide native binaries for OS X 10.7 (Lion) and above. _OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) or higher is required for HTTPS support. See [issue #5681][i5681] for more information._

[i5681]: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/5681

[Download](https://download.rethinkdb.com/repository/raw/osx/rethinkdb-{{site.version.full}}.dmg) the disk
image, run `rethinkdb.pkg`, and follow the installation instructions.

# Using Homebrew #

_Prerequisites:_ Make sure you're on OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) or above, and
have [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) installed.

Run the following in your terminal:

```bash
brew update && brew install rethinkdb
```

# Compile from source #

Building RethinkDB from source requires OS X 10.9 (Maverick) or greater. [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) is required to
build from source.

## Get the source code ##

Download and extract the archive:

```bash
curl -O https://download.rethinkdb.com/repository/raw/dist/rethinkdb-{{site.version.full}}.tgz
tar xf rethinkdb-{{site.version.full}}.tgz
```

## Build RethinkDB ##

Kick off the build process:

```bash
cd rethinkdb-{{site.version.full}}
./configure --allow-fetch --fetch openssl
make
```

You will find the `rethinkdb` binary in the `build/release/` subfolder.

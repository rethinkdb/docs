The steps necessary for migrating data to current RethinkDB versions from previous ones depend on which version you're migrating from.

{% toctag %}

* **1.16 or higher:** Migration is handled automatically. (This is also true for upgrading from 1.14 onward to versions earlier than 2.2.) See "General instructions" below.
* **1.13&ndash;1.15:** Upgrade to RethinkDB 2.0.5 *first,* rebuild the secondary indexes by following the "Rebuilding indexes" directions, then upgrade to 2.1 or higher. (Migration from 2.0.5 to 2.1+ will be handled automatically.)
* **1.7&ndash;1.12:** Follow the "Migrating old data" directions.
* **1.6 or earlier:** Read the "Deprecated versions" section.

# Back up your data

While it's not strictly necessary to back up your data before upgrading, it's always a good idea. You should make a backup by using the `dump` command *before* updating RethinkDB to its new version! Databases that have been automatically upgraded are not backward-compatible (that is, a database from version 1.14 cannot be used with version 1.13).

Use the `dump` subcommand from the command line to create an archive of data from the cluster. This creates a **tar.gz** file consisting of JSON documents and additional table metadata.

    rethinkdb dump [options]

The `restore` subcommand will reload a backup an archive into your cluster.

    rethinkdb restore filename

Use `rethinkdb help <command>` for a list of options. For more details, see [Backing up your data][backup].

[backup]: /docs/backup/

{% infobox alert %}
__Note:__ The `dump` and `restore` commands require the [Python driver](/docs/install-drivers/python/) to be installed. Don't upgrade the Python driver until *after* you've dumped the data!

If you don't have the Python driver installed, you can install a previous version using `pip install rethinkdb==<version>`. (You can use the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rethinkdb "PyPI > rethinkdb") to check on current and older versions.)
{% endinfobox %}

# General instructions

Check the release notes in `NOTES.md` to see if there are
cluster-incompatible changes.

For major version updates, which have cluster-incompatible changes,
upgrading your cluster involves temporary down time and consists of the
following steps:

  - Shut down every node of the cluster.
  - Replace the `rethinkdb` binaries with newer versions.
  - Start up every node of the cluster.
  - If necessary, rebuild indexes.

For minor version updates, you can shut down and restart each node
individually.

# Rebuilding indexes

When you upgrade a major release (i.e., 2.1 to 2.2), you should rebuild *outdated* secondary indexes manually. After starting up your cluster, this can be done easily from the command line.  This will connect to the cluster and tell it to rebuild outdated indexes:

    rethinkdb index-rebuild [-c HOST:PORT] [-n NUM] [-r (DB | DB.TABLE)] [--tls-cert FILENAME] [-p] [--password-file FILENAME]...

This is *required* if you're upgrading from versions before 1.16; in those cases, you'll need to upgrade to version 2.0.5 first. (You can download 2.0.5 and other older versions at RethinkDB's [download archive](https://download.rethinkdb.com)). If you're upgrading from RethinkDB version 1.16 or later, you can move to 2.2 or higher directly.

Note that rebuilding indexes is typically *not* required if you're
upgrading between minor releases (i.e., 2.2.0 to 2.2.1).  (Check the
release notes in `NOTES.md` to be sure.)

## What are outdated secondary indexes?

A document's location or presence within a secondary index can be affected if

  - a ReQL command changes its behavior, and
  - that ReQL command is used by the secondary index.

Upon migration, that secondary index becomes *outdated*.  The outdated
index will continue to function, using the previous versioned behavior
of the command, with the documents in their original locations.  To
avoid any subtly confusing behavior, you will probably want to rebuild
the index.

# Migrating old data

*These steps are only necessary if you're upgrading from RethinkDB version 1.7&ndash;1.12 to version 2.1 or higher.* If you're using a later version, see the sections above. (If you're using 1.6 or earlier, read the "[Deprecated versions](#deprecated-versions)" section below.)

Migration consists of three simple steps:

  - Export your data from the existing version of RethinkDB
  - Upgrade RethinkDB to a new version
  - Import the data into the new version of RethinkDB

{% infobox alert %}
You must export your data **before** you've upgraded RethinkDB to a new version! If you've already updated, you can find binaries for previous versions in the [download archive](https://download.rethinkdb.com).
{% endinfobox %}

## Exporting your data

To export your data, use `rethinkdb dump`:

    rethinkdb dump -c <host>:<port>

This command will export all your data to a `tar.gz` file named `rethinkdb_dump_<timestamp>.tar.gz` (this may vary depending on your platform).

Use `rethinkdb help <command>` for a list of options. For more details, see [Backing up your data][backup].

## Upgrading RethinkDB

First, upgrade the RethinkDB server and drivers to the latest version:

- See [server install instructions](/install) for your platform.
- See [driver install instructions](/docs/install-drivers/) for your language.

{% infobox %}
__Keep in mind__: 

- Don't upgrade the Python driver until *after* you've dumped the data.
- [Upgrade](/docs/install-drivers/python/) the Python driver for the `restore` step below. 
{% endinfobox %}

Then make sure to move or delete the old RethinkDB data directory
(`rethinkdb_data` by default), since the new version will not be able
to read the old file.

## Importing your data

To import your data, use `rethinkdb restore`:

    rethinkdb restore <exported_file> -c <host>:<port>

Use `rethinkdb restore --help` to see the complete list of options for importing your data. Again, for more details, see [Backing up your data][backup].

After importing your data, you'll need to rebuild your secondary indexes.

    rethinkdb index-rebuild

{% infobox alert %}
The cluster configuration is *not* exported in backup. After a full restore, it will need to be manually reconfigured.
{% endinfobox %}

# Deprecated versions

Upgrading from RethinkDB versions 1.6 or earlier has *not* been tested with RethinkDB 2.1 and higher. However, you should be able to use the deprecated [migration script][ms].

[ms]: https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/tree/02b4f29e1e7f15b3edffcb68bf015578ec5783ab/scripts/migration

Follow the directions in the README file to perform the migration.

# Downgrading RethinkDB

Downgrading RethinkDB clusters to previous versions is not supported,
and generally, will not work.  A possible exception is downgrading
between certain minor releases.

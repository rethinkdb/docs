{% endapibody %}

# Description #

Join tables using a field on the left-hand sequence matching primary keys or secondary indexes on the right-hand table. `eqJoin` is more efficient than other ReQL join types, and operates much faster. Documents in the result set consist of pairs of left-hand and right-hand documents, matched when the field on the left-hand side exists and is non-null and an entry with that field's value exists in the specified index on the right-hand side.

The result set of `eqJoin` is a stream or array of objects. Each object in the returned set will be an object of the form `{ left: <left-document>, right: <right-document> }`, where the values of `left` and `right` will be the joined documents. Use the <code><a href="/api/javascript/zip/">zip</a></code> command to merge the `left` and `right` fields together.

**Example:** Match players with the games they've played against one another.

The players table contains these documents:

```js
[
    { id: 1, player: 'George', gameId: 1 },
    { id: 2, player: 'Agatha', gameId: 3 },
    { id: 3, player: 'Fred', gameId: 2 },
    { id: 4, player: 'Marie', gameId: 2 },
    { id: 5, player: 'Earnest', gameId: 1 },
    { id: 6, player: 'Beth', gameId: 3 }
]
```

The games table contains these documents:

```js
[
    { id: 1, field: 'Little Delving' },
    { id: 2, field: 'Rushock Bog' },
    { id: 3, field: 'Bucklebury' }
]
```

Join these tables using `gameId` on the player table and `id` on the games table:

```js
r.table('players').eqJoin('gameId', r.table('games')).run(conn, callback)
```

This will return a result set such as the following:

```js
[
    {
        "left" : { "gameId" : 3, "id" : 2, "player" : "Agatha" },
        "right" : { "id" : 3, "field" : "Bucklebury" }
    },
    {
        "left" : { "gameId" : 2, "id" : 3, "player" : "Fred" },
        "right" : { "id" : 2, "field" : "Rushock Bog" }
    },
    ...
]
```

What you likely want is the result of using `zip` with that. For clarity, we'll use `without` to drop the `id` field from the games table (it conflicts with the `id` field for the players and it's redundant anyway), and we'll order it by the games.

```js
r.table('players').eqJoin('gameId', r.table('games')).without({right: "id"}).zip().orderBy('gameId').run(conn, callback)

[
    { "field": "Little Delving", "gameId": 1, "id": 5, "player": "Earnest" },
    { "field": "Little Delving", "gameId": 1, "id": 1, "player": "George" },
    { "field": "Rushock Bog", "gameId": 2, "id": 3, "player": "Fred" },
    { "field": "Rushock Bog", "gameId": 2, "id": 4, "player": "Marie" },
    { "field": "Bucklebury", "gameId": 3, "id": 6, "player": "Beth" },
    { "field": "Bucklebury", "gameId": 3, "id": 2, "player": "Agatha" }
]
```

For more information, see [Table joins in RethinkDB](/docs/table-joins/).

**Example:** Use a secondary index on the right table rather than the primary key. If players have a secondary index on their cities, we can get a list of arenas with players in the same area.

```js
r.table('arenas').eqJoin('cityId', r.table('arenas'), {index: 'cityId'}).run(conn, callback)
```

**Example:** Use a nested key as the join field. Suppose the documents in the players table were structured like this:

```js
{ id: 1, player: 'George', game: {id: 1} },
{ id: 2, player: 'Agatha', game: {id: 3} },
...
```

Simply specify the field using the `row` command instead of a string.

```js
r.table('players').eqJoin(r.row('game')('id'), r.table('games')).without({right: 'id'}).zip()

[
    { "field": "Little Delving", "game": { "id": 1 }, "id": 5, "player": "Earnest" },
    { "field": "Little Delving", "game": { "id": 1 }, "id": 1, "player": "George" },
    ...
]
```

**Example:** Use a function instead of a field to join on a more complicated expression. Suppose the players have lists of favorite games ranked in order in a field such as `favorites: [3, 2, 1]`. Get a list of players and their top favorite:

```js
r.table('players').eqJoin(function (player) {
    return player('favorites').nth(0)
}, r.table('games')).without([{left: ['favorites', 'gameId', 'id']}, {right: 'id'}]).zip()
```

Result:

```js
[
	{ "field": "Rushock Bog", "name": "Fred" },
	{ "field": "Little Delving", "name": "George" },
	...
]
```

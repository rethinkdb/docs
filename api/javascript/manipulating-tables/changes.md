# Description #

Return a changefeed, an infinite stream of objects representing changes to a query. A changefeed may return changes to a table or an individual document (a "point" changefeed), and document transformation commands such as `filter` or `map` may be used before the `changes` command to affect the output.

There are four optional arguments to `changes`.

* `squash`: Controls how change notifications are batched. Acceptable values are `true`, `false` and a numeric value:
    * `true`: When multiple changes to the same document occur before a batch of notifications is sent, the changes are "squashed" into one change. The client receives a notification that will bring it fully up to date with the server.
    * `false`: All changes will be sent to the client verbatim. This is the default.
    * `n`: A numeric value (floating point). Similar to `true`, but the server will wait `n` seconds to respond in order to squash as many changes together as possible, reducing network traffic. The first batch will always be returned immediately.
* `changefeedQueueSize`: the number of changes the server will buffer between client reads before it starts dropping changes and generates an error (default: 100,000).
* `includeInitial`: if `true`, the changefeed stream will begin with the current contents of the table or selection being monitored. These initial results will have `new_val` fields, but no `old_val` fields. The initial results may be intermixed with actual changes, as long as an initial result for the changed document has already been given.
* `includeStates`: if `true`, the changefeed stream will include special status documents consisting of the field `state` and a string indicating a change in the feed's state. These documents can occur at any point in the feed between the notification documents described below. If `includeStates` is `false` (the default), the status documents will not be sent.

There are currently two states:

* `{state: 'initializing'}` indicates the following documents represent initial values on the feed rather than changes. This will be the first document of a feed that returns initial values.
* `{state: 'ready'}` indicates the following documents represent changes. This will be the first document of a feed that does *not* return initial values; otherwise, it will indicate the initial values have all been sent.

{% infobox %}
Starting with RethinkDB 2.2, state documents will *only* be sent if the `includeStates` option is `true`, even on point changefeeds. Initial values will only be sent if `includeInitial` is `true`. If `includeStates` is `true` and `includeInitial` is false, the first document on the feed will be `{state: 'ready'}`.
{% endinfobox %}

If the table becomes unavailable, the changefeed will be disconnected, and a runtime exception will be thrown by the driver.

Changefeed notifications take the form of a two-field object:

```js
{
    "old_val": <document before change>,
    "new_val": <document after change>
}
```

When a document is deleted, `new_val` will be `null`; when a document is inserted, `old_val` will be `null`.

{% infobox %}
Certain document transformation commands can be chained before changefeeds. For more information, read the [discussion of changefeeds](/docs/changefeeds/javascript/) in the "Query language" documentation.
{% endinfobox %}

The server will buffer up to `changefeedQueueSize` elements (default 100,000). If the buffer limit is hit, early changes will be discarded, and the client will receive an object of the form `{error: "Changefeed cache over array size limit, skipped X elements."}` where `X` is the number of elements skipped.

Commands that operate on streams (such as [filter](/api/javascript/filter/) or [map](/api/javascript/map/)) can usually be chained after `changes`.  However, since the stream produced by `changes` has no ending, commands that need to consume the entire stream before returning (such as [reduce](/api/javascript/reduce/) or [count](/api/javascript/count/)) cannot.

__Example:__ Subscribe to the changes on a table.

Start monitoring the changefeed in one client:

```js
r.table('games').changes().run(conn, function(err, cursor) {
  cursor.each(console.log);
});
```

As these queries are performed in a second client, the first
client would receive and print the following objects:

```js
> r.table('games').insert({id: 1}).run(conn, callback);
{old_val: null, new_val: {id: 1}}

> r.table('games').get(1).update({player1: 'Bob'}).run(conn, callback);
{old_val: {id: 1}, new_val: {id: 1, player1: 'Bob'}}

> r.table('games').get(1).replace({id: 1, player1: 'Bob', player2: 'Alice'}).run(conn, callback);
{old_val: {id: 1, player1: 'Bob'},
 new_val: {id: 1, player1: 'Bob', player2: 'Alice'}}

> r.table('games').get(1).delete().run(conn, callback)
{old_val: {id: 1, player1: 'Bob', player2: 'Alice'}, new_val: null}

> r.tableDrop('games').run(conn, callback);
ReqlRuntimeError: Changefeed aborted (table unavailable)
```

__Example:__ Return all the changes that increase a player's score.

```js
r.table('test').changes().filter(
  r.row('new_val')('score').gt(r.row('old_val')('score'))
).run(conn, callback)
```

__Example:__ Return all the changes to a specific player's score that increase it past 10.

```js
r.table('test').get(1).filter(r.row('score').gt(10)).changes().run(conn, callback)
```

__Example:__ Return all the inserts on a table.

```js
r.table('test').changes().filter(r.row('old_val').eq(null)).run(conn, callback)
```

__Example:__ Return all the changes to game 1, with state notifications and initial values.

```js
r.table('games').get(1).changes({includeInitial: true, includeStates: true}).run(conn, callback);
// Result returned on changefeed
{state: 'initializing'}
{new_val: {id: 1, score: 12, arena: 'Hobbiton Field'}}
{state: 'ready'}
{
	old_val: {id: 1, score: 12, arena: 'Hobbiton Field'},
	new_val: {id: 1, score: 14, arena: 'Hobbiton Field'}
}
{
	old_val: {id: 1, score: 14, arena: 'Hobbiton Field'},
	new_val: {id: 1, score: 17, arena: 'Hobbiton Field', winner: 'Frodo'}
}
```

__Example:__ Return all the changes to the top 10 games. This assumes the presence of a `score` secondary index on the `games` table.

```js
r.table('games').orderBy({index: r.desc('score')}).limit(10).changes().run(conn, callback);
```

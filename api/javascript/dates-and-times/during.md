# Command syntax #

{% apibody %}
time.during(startTime, endTime[, {leftBound: "closed", rightBound: "open"}]) &rarr; bool
{% endapibody %}

# Description #

Return whether a time is between two other times.

By default, this is inclusive of the start time and exclusive of the end time. Set `leftBound` and `rightBound` to explicitly include (`closed`) or exclude (`open`) that endpoint of the range.

__Example:__ Retrieve all the posts that were posted between December 1st, 2013
(inclusive) and December 10th, 2013 (exclusive).

```javascript
r.table("posts").filter(
    r.row('date').during(r.time(2013, 12, 1, "Z"), r.time(2013, 12, 10, "Z"))
).run(conn, callback)

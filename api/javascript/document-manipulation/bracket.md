# Command syntax #

{% apibody %}

array(index) &rarr; value
{% endapibody %}

# Description #

Get a single field from an object. If called on a sequence, gets that field from every object in the sequence, skipping objects that lack it.

__Example:__ What was Iron Man's first appearance in a comic?

```javascript
r.table('marvel').get('IronMan')('firstAppearance').run(conn, callback)
```

<!-- stop -->

The `()` command also accepts integer arguments as array offsets, like the [nth](/api/javascript/nth) command.

__Example:__ Get the fourth element in a sequence. (The first element is position `0`, so the fourth element is position `3`.)

```javascript
r.expr([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])(3)

40
```

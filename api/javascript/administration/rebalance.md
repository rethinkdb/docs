# Description #

Rebalances the shards of a table. When called on a database, all the tables in that database will be rebalanced.

The `rebalance` command operates by measuring the distribution of primary keys within a table and picking split points that will give each shard approximately the same number of documents. It won't change the number of shards within a table, or change any other configuration aspect for the table or the database.

A table will lose availability temporarily after `rebalance` is called; use the [wait](/api/javascript/wait) command to wait for the table to become available again, or [status](/api/javascript/status) to check if the table is available for writing.

RethinkDB automatically rebalances tables when the number of shards are increased, and as long as your documents have evenly distributed primary keys&mdash;such as the default UUIDs&mdash;it is rarely necessary to call `rebalance` manually. Cases where `rebalance` may need to be called include:

* Tables with unevenly distributed primary keys, such as incrementing integers
* Changing a table's primary key type
* Increasing the number of shards on an empty table, then using non-UUID primary keys in that table

The [web UI](/docs/administration-tools/) (and the [info](/api/javascript/info) command) can be used to tell you when a table's shards need to be rebalanced.

The return value of `rebalance` is an object with two fields:

* `rebalanced`: the number of tables rebalanced.
* `status_changes`: a list of new and old table status values. Each element of the list will be an object with two fields:
    * `old_val`: The table's [status](/api/javascript/status) value before `rebalance` was executed. 
    * `new_val`: The table's `status` value after `rebalance` was executed. (This value will almost always indicate the table is unavailable.)

See the [status](/api/javascript/status) command for an explanation of the objects returned in the `old_val` and `new_val` fields.

__Example:__ Rebalance a table.

```javascript
> r.table('superheroes').rebalance().run(conn, callback);
```

<!-- stop -->

# Description #

Select a given number of elements from a sequence with uniform random distribution. Selection is done without replacement.

If the sequence has less than the requested number of elements (i.e., calling `sample(10)` on a sequence with only five elements), `sample` will return the entire sequence in a random order.

__Example:__ Select 3 random heroes.

```javascript
r.table('marvel').sample(3).run(conn, callback)
```

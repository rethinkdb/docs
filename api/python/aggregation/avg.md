# Command syntax #

{% apibody %}
sequence.avg([field_or_function]) &rarr; number
{% endapibody %}

# Description #

Averages all the elements of a sequence.  If called with a field name,
averages all the values of that field in the sequence, skipping
elements of the sequence that lack that field.  If called with a
function, calls that function on every element of the sequence and
averages the results, skipping elements of the sequence where that
function returns `None` or a non-existence error.

Produces a non-existence error when called on an empty sequence.  You
can handle this case with `default`.

__Example:__ What's the average of 3, 5, and 7?

```py
r.expr([3, 5, 7]).avg().run(conn)
```

__Example:__ What's the average number of points scored in a game?

```py
r.table('games').avg('points').run(conn)
```

__Example:__ What's the average number of points scored in a game,
counting bonus points?

```py
r.table('games').avg(
    lambda game: game['points'] + game['bonus_points']
).run(conn)
```

__Example:__ What's the average number of points scored in a game?
(But return `None` instead of erroring of there are no games where
points have been scored.)

```py
r.table('games').avg('points').default(None).run(conn)
```

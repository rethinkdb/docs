# Command syntax #

{% apibody %}
table.setWriteHook(function | binary | null) &rarr; object
{% endapibody %}

# Description #

Sets the write hook on a table or overwrites it if one already exists.

The `function` can be an anonymous function with the signature `(context: object, oldVal: object, newVal: object) -> object` or a binary representation obtained from the `function` field of [getWriteHook](/api/java/get_write_hook). The function must be deterministic, and so cannot use a subquery or the `r.js` command.

The first argument, `context`, is a ReQL object containing the following properties:

- `primary_key`: primary key of the document being deleted, inserted, or modified
- `timestamp`: a ReQL `time` object representing the current query execution time

{% infobox %}
As is the case when creating secondary index functions using [indexCreate](/api/java/index_create), `r.now()` is considered non-deterministic and is thus not allowed in the context of write hooks. If you need to reference the current timestamp, `context.g("timestamp")` should be used instead.
{% endinfobox %}

Whenever a write operation on the table inserts, deletes or modifies a given document, the write hook function will be called with the context parameter, the old value of the document (or `null` on inserts) and the new value of the document (or `null` on deletes). It then returns the value that should actually be inserted and/or replaced instead of `newVal`. It can also return `r.error(...)` to abort the write.

For simplicity, the write hook function is allowed to return `null` exactly if and only if `newVal` is `null`. This is just a safeguard to ensure you don't accidentally turn an insert/update into a deletion, or a deletion into an update.

If successful, `setWriteHook` returns an object of the form:

```json
{
  "created": 1,
}
```

```json
{
  "replaced": 1,
}
```

or

```json
{
  "deleted": 1,
}
```

__Example:__ Create a write hook that sets `modified_at` to the current time on each write operation.

```java
r.table("comments").setWriteHook((context, oldVal, newVal) ->
  newVal.merge(r.object("modified_at", context.g("timestamp")))
).run(conn);
```

__Example:__ Delete the write hook associated with the `comments` table.

```java
r.table("comments").setWriteHook(null).run(conn);
```

__Example:__ Recreate an outdated write hook on a table.

```java
r.table("posts").getWriteHook().do((writeHook) ->
    r.table("posts").setWriteHook(writeHook.g("function"))
).run(conn);
```

# Command syntax #

{% apibody %}
sequence.has_fields([selector1, selector2...]) &rarr; stream
array.has_fields([selector1, selector2...]) &rarr; array
object.has_fields([selector1, selector2...]) &rarr; boolean
{% endapibody %}

# Description #

Test if an object has one or more fields. An object has a field if it has that key and the key has a non-null value. For instance, the object `{'a': 1,'b': 2,'c': null}` has the fields `a` and `b`.

When applied to a single object, `has_fields` returns `true` if the object has the fields and `false` if it does not. When applied to a sequence, it will return a new sequence (an array or stream) containing the elements that have the specified fields.

__Example:__ Return the players who have won games.

```rb
r.table('players').has_fields(:games_won).run(conn)
```

__Example:__ Test if a specific player has won any games.

```rb
r.table('players').get(
    'b5ec9714-837e-400c-aa74-dbd35c9a7c4c'
).has_fields(:games_won).run(conn)
```

**Nested Fields**

`has_fields` lets you test for nested fields in objects. If the value of a field is itself a set of key/value pairs, you can test for the presence of specific keys.

__Example:__ In the `players` table, the `games_won` field contains one or more fields for kinds of games won:

```rb
{
    :games_won => {
        :playoffs => 2,
        :championships => 1
    }
}
```

Return players who have the "championships" field.

```rb
r.table('players').has_fields(
    {:games_won => {:championships => true}}
).run(conn)
```

Note that `true` in the example above is testing for the existence of `championships` as a field, not testing to see if the value of the `championships` field is set to `true`. There's a more convenient shorthand form available. (See [pluck](/api/ruby/pluck) for more details on this.)

```rb
r.table('players').has_fields({:games_won => :championships}).run(conn)
```

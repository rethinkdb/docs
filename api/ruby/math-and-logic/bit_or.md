r.bit_or(number) &rarr; number
r.bit_or(number[, number, ...]) &rarr; number
{% endapibody %}

# Description #

A bitwise OR is a binary operation that takes two bit patterns of equal length and performs the logical inclusive OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. The result in each position is 0 if both bits are 0, while otherwise the result is 1.

__Example:__

```rb
> r.expr(5).bit_or(3).run(conn)

7
```

# Command syntax #

{% apibody %}
table.set_write_hook(function | binary | null) &rarr; object
{% endapibody %}

# Description #

Sets the write hook on a table or overwrites it if one already exists.

The `function` can be an anonymous function with the signature `(context: object, old_val: object, new_val: object) -> object` or a binary representation obtained from the `function` field of [get_write_hook](/api/ruby/get_write_hook). The function must be deterministic, and so cannot use a subquery or the `r.js` command.

The first argument, `context`, is a ReQL object containing the following properties:

- `primary_key`: primary key of the document being deleted, inserted, or modified
- `timestamp`: a ReQL `time` object representing the current query execution time

{% infobox %}
As is the case when creating secondary index functions using [index_create](/api/ruby/index_create), `r.now()` is considered non-deterministic and is thus not allowed in the context of write hooks. If you need to reference the current timestamp, `context['timestamp']` should be used instead.
{% endinfobox %}

Whenever a write operation on the table inserts, deletes or modifies a given document, the write hook function will be called with the context parameter, the old value of the document (or `null` on inserts) and the new value of the document (or `null` on deletes). It then returns the value that should actually be inserted and/or replaced instead of `new_val`. It can also return `r.error(...)` to abort the write.

For simplicity, the write hook function is allowed to return `null` exactly if and only if `new_val` is `null`. This is just a safeguard to ensure you don't accidentally turn an insert/update into a deletion, or a deletion into an update.

If successful, `set_write_hook` returns an object of the form:

```rb
{
  :created => 1,
}
```

or

```rb
{
  :replaced => 1,
}
```

or

```rb
{
  :deleted => 1,
}
```

__Example:__ Create a write hook that sets `modified_at` to the current time on each write operation.

```rb
r.table('comments').set_write_hook { |context, old_val, new_val|
    new_val.merge({
        :modified_at => context['timestamp']
    })
).run(conn)
```

__Example:__ Delete the write hook associated with the `comments` table.

```rb
r.table('comments').set_write_hook(nil).run(conn)
```

__Example:__ Recreate an outdated write hook on a table.

```rb
r.table('posts').get_write_hook().do { |write_hook|
    r.table('posts').set_write_hook(write_hook['function'])
}).run(conn)
```
